sudoku is a simple playable [Sudoku Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) which is built using [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) in Python. It is a graphical-user interface based project. \
*Date of creation:* `27 June, 2021`

This project is a single-player. After choosing a difficulty level, the player can start solving the puzzle on the 9Ã—9 Grid.

## Features

## Footnotes

- Difficulty level corresponds to the number of cells of the grid whose values are known. The harder the level, the fewer initial values are given.
- The number of cells initially given are chosen randomly according to the selected level.
- Some sudoku-grids have [multiple solutions](https://masteringsudoku.com/can-sudoku-have-multiple-solutions/).
